“Planting a tree equals saving lives for free”

To beat the scorching heat and to beautify our campus, the Rotaract club organised a tree plantation drive on the IITJ Institute Foundation Day. The event was inaugurated on 2nd August by our respected Director Sir, Prof. Shantanu Chaudhary with the kind participation of Dr Shekhar Mande, Director Gen, CSIR, and Dr R Chidambaram, Chairman of Board of Governers, IITJ, who all planted the first plants of the drive.

The program was further extended with enthusiasm on 3rd August and started by 8:30 am, where faculty members and students showed up with great eagerness. The drive was aided by the Padmini Rotary of Jodhpur under its Green Mission. They provided us plants of over 100 different varieties which were planted across the campus. Students and faculty members also adopted plants and saplings to take care of.

To add to excitement of the event, the raingods let down a heavy rainshower.. Despite the unexpected rains, everyone was dedicated and willing to complete the task and also enjoyed themselves. It was a successful and memorable program of the institute.
