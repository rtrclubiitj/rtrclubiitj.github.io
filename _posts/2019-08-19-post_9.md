It is a day dedicated to recognize humanitarian personnel and all those who have lost their lives working for humanitarian causes.
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is leading in the efforts to plan and guide the observance of the day that is commemorated world wide by governments, the United Nations, international humanitarian organizations and NGOs.

This day was commerated for the first time on 19th august 2009. In all the subsequent years, each day was focused on a particular theme.
This year the theme adopted by United Nations is "Women Humanitarians".
Majorly honouring the work of women in crises throughout the world, the main motive is to ultimately focus on the unsung heroes, who have been working on the front lines for a long time without the much deserved recognition.
