The Club is really glad to announce that it has achieved a milestone by
obtaining an overall 29th rank among 117 Rotaract organizations all over the
world this year for the project, International Literacy Day-Literacy for Change project, organized by Rotaract Club of Islamabad. This is only achieved by the collaborative work of the entire Rotaract Club team. The diligence, self-motivation as well as dedication to
always go the extra mile in order to achieve the best result is main reason for
this success. It is truly the hard work of the entire team that have turned this
club around. We just hope that such performances to be continued and even go
better in coming future ventures.
