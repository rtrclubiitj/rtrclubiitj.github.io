On 28th August, 2018, we organized a meeting to finalize the dates of the cloth donation drive. Moreover, planning for other events aiming to serve the society was presented and discussed among the members.

The first iteration of cloth donation drive is planned to be held on Teachers day, that is, 5th September, 2018. Timings and venue will be circulated in the coming days. 

Expecting an active participation.
