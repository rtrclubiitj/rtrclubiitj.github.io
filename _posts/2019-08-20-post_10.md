Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. You don't have to have a college degree to serve. You don't have to make your subject and your verb agree to serve.... You don't have to know the second theory of thermodynamics in physics to serve. You only need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love.
â€• Martin Luther King, Jr.

Rotaract Club of IIT Jodhpur organised a clothes distribution drive for the labourers who work at the IIT campus.

Over the last month, donated clothes were collected, sorted, laundered and packed. The poor labourers were informed about the distribution date and venue and details were collected from them.

On the designated date, all the Rotaractors enthusiastically took part in the distribution drive and managed it smoothly.

Thanks to Rotary Club Of Jodhpur Padmini for guiding and motivating us.
