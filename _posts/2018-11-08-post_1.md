On the auspicious occasion of Deepawali, we along with Social Service Club of IIT Jodhpur, went to the labor camp to celebrate the festival.
We began by worshipping, which was followed by sweet distribution and lightening candles in the area. 

About 700 people were with us to share the happiness of this occasion, thus bringing out the real meaning of Deepawali.
