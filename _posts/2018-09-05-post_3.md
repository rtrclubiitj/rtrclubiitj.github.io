Along with the celebration of Teachers' Day, we organized a Cloth Distribution Event at our campus. We received a very good amount of participation. Around 140 people showed interest in receiving the clothes during the event. There were many counters arranged to ease out the distribution process. Moreover, there was a questionnaire which was filled up by anyone coming to take clothes. It helped us to plan our future events. Based on the responses, around 81.2% people showed interest in a health checkup to be organised and hence, our upcoming event might be a health checkup in our campus for those who are unable to afford this basic facility.
