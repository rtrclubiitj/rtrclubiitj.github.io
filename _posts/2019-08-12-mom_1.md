With the motivation of learning more from our mentors who are spending each day working for the betterment of other people, a casual hangout meeting was organised on 12 August 2019 in The LaughingB restaurant.
The meeting began at around 4:00 PM. We were honoured  to have distinguished officials such as Rtn.Sushma Niraj Sethia, Rtn.Preeti,Rtn.Sanjay Malviya.

Sushma  Ma’am and Sanjay Malviya Sir made us realise the worth of each individual and how each one of us can contribute towards solving the current issues which are persisiting in the society. We also learned the values needed to grow as a person to give back to the society we are part of. 

Rtn.Preeti Ma’am exchanged words of wisdom and her guidance will help us in planning the future steps of the club. It was a fun and a learning  experience for all the members and we look forward to more such interactions with  more influential people contributing in the society with their words and actions.
